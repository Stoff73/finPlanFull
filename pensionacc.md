Absolutely—here’s a precise, HMRC-sourced guide to UK pension **accumulation** rules (personal & occupational), focused on the **current tax year 2025/26**. I’m keeping this strictly to verified values and official definitions, with citations after each load-bearing fact.

# Key allowances & limits (2025/26)

* **Annual Allowance (AA):** **£60,000** total pension “input amount” across all schemes (your contributions, employer contributions and tax relief), before any taper/MPAA applies. ([GOV.UK][1])
* **Tapered Annual Allowance thresholds:**

  * **Threshold income:** **£200,000**; if **≤ £200k** your AA is **not** tapered. ([GOV.UK][2])
  * **Adjusted income:** **£260,000**; if **> £260k**, your AA reduces by **£1 for every £2** over this, **to a minimum AA of £10,000**. (The minimum is reached when adjusted income is **£360,000** or more.) ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Minimum tapered AA:** **£10,000**. ([GOV.UK][1])
* **Money Purchase Annual Allowance (MPAA):** **£10,000** once you’ve **flexibly accessed** DC benefits (see “Triggers”). MPAA applies to **DC** inputs and you **cannot use carry-forward to exceed the MPAA for DC**. ([GOV.UK][1])
* **Alternative Annual Allowance (for DB when MPAA applies):** **£50,000** (i.e., full AA minus the MPAA, where relevant). ([GOV.UK][1])
* **Tax relief on member contributions (personal or via workplace):** available up to the **higher of 100% of your UK relevant earnings or £3,600 gross** (before applying the AA). ([GOV.UK][1])
* **Normal Minimum Pension Age (NMPA):** access is generally age **55**, rising to **57 from 6 April 2028** (with limited protections/exceptions). ([GOV.UK][3])
* **Lump Sum Allowance (LSA):** **£268,275** standard cap on tax-free lump sums you can take over your lifetime (replaced the old LTA tax-free % framework). ([GOV.UK][1])
* **Lump Sum & Death Benefit Allowance (LSDBA):** **£1,073,100** standard limit for total tax-free lump sums **and** lump-sum death benefits combined. ([GOV.UK][1])
* **Overseas Transfer Allowance (OTA):** **£1,073,100** standard (relevant for certain transfers overseas). ([GOV.UK][1])
* **Auto-enrolment thresholds (2025/26):**

  * **Earnings trigger for AE:** **£10,000** p.a.
  * **Qualifying earnings band:** **£6,240** to **£50,270** p.a. (used to calculate statutory minimum AE contributions). ([The Pensions Regulator][4])

# How the main allowances work (with exact HMRC definitions)

## 1) Annual Allowance (AA) and “pension input amount”

* Your **pension input amount** for a year is the total of all contributions to **DC** plus the **deemed growth** in any **DB** benefits for that tax year (the “pension input period” is the tax year). If the total exceeds your available AA (after taper and carry-forward), the **excess is taxed at your marginal rate** via the annual allowance charge. ([GOV.UK][2])

## 2) Tapered Annual Allowance (for high earners)

* **Step 1: work out net income** (HMRC gives a precise method). ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Step 2: work out threshold income** = net income **minus** gross “relief-at-source” member contributions **plus** post-8 July 2015 **salary-sacrifice/flexible remuneration** additions back, **minus** any lump-sum death benefits received. If **threshold income ≤ £200k**, taper does **not** apply even if adjusted income is high. ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Step 3: work out adjusted income** = net income **plus** (i) any member contributions where relief was claimed after payment, **plus** (ii) **employer DC contributions**/**DB deemed savings**, **minus** any lump-sum death benefits. If **adjusted income > £260k**, AA is tapered by **£1 for each £2** over £260k, **to a floor of £10k**. (At **£360k+**, AA hits £10k.) ([GOV.UK][2])

**Worked example (taper):** Adjusted income **£320,000**. Excess over £260k = **£60,000**. Taper reduction = £60,000/2 = **£30,000**. **AA = £60,000 − £30,000 = £30,000** (before any carry-forward). (Method per HMRC.) ([GOV.UK][2])

## 3) Money Purchase Annual Allowance (MPAA)

* MPAA **applies from (and including) the tax year in which you first “flexibly access”** your DC benefits and in any later year where it bites harder than the regular AA. Typical **trigger events** include taking an **uncrystallised funds pension lump sum (UFPLS)** or starting **flexi-access drawdown with taxable income**. Once triggered, **DC** inputs above **£10,000** in a year cause an **AA charge**; and **you cannot use carry-forward to extend the DC limit above the MPAA**. (You may still use the **Alternative AA** for any **DB** accrual.) ([GOV.UK][5])

## 4) Carry-forward (using unused AA from prior years)

* You can **carry forward up to three previous tax years’** **unused AA** to increase your available AA in the current year (order of use: **earliest first**). You **must have been a member** of a registered pension scheme in those years. ([GOV.UK][6])
* **Important:** **Unused MPAA cannot be carried forward** to increase the DC limit; carry-forward **does not** allow DC inputs above **£10,000** when the MPAA applies. ([GOV.UK][7])

**Worked example (carry-forward with no taper/MPAA):**
Current year planned input = **£90,000**; standard AA = **£60,000**. You have **£25,000** unused AA from 2023/24 and **£5,000** from 2022/23. You can add **£30,000** carry-forward to your **£60,000** current AA and fully shelter the **£90,000** from an AA charge (subject to **100% of earnings** rule for member contributions). ([GOV.UK][1])

# Personal vs Occupational (accumulation mechanics)

## Personal pensions (incl. SIPPs, stakeholder)

* **Member contributions** can get tax relief up to the higher of **100% of UK earnings or £3,600** gross, but always within your **available AA**. ([GOV.UK][1])
* Relief method typically **relief-at-source**: you pay net; provider adds basic-rate relief and you claim higher/additional rate via Self Assessment. (This interacts with **threshold income** because gross relief-at-source contributions are **deducted** in the threshold-income calc.) ([GOV.UK][2])

## Occupational/workplace pensions

* **Auto-enrolment**: if you earn **£10,000+**, you’ll normally be auto-enrolled; statutory minima are based on **qualifying earnings** between **£6,240** and **£50,270** (2025/26). Total minimum is **8%**, typically **3% employer + 5% employee** (incl. basic-rate relief). ([The Pensions Regulator][4])
* **Net pay vs relief-at-source**: many trust-based workplace schemes use **net pay** (contributions deducted before tax), which affects how relief shows up on payslips and **does not** reduce threshold income the same way as relief-at-source contributions (HMRC defines both in the taper calc). ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Salary sacrifice** (post-8 July 2015 variants) is **added back** into **threshold income**, which can matter for tapering; it still can improve **NI efficiency**. ([GOV.UK][2])

# Tax-free lump-sum framework (post-LTA abolition)

* From **6 April 2024**, the **Lifetime Allowance** was abolished; instead you have:

  * **Lump Sum Allowance (LSA): £268,275** (standard).
  * **Lump Sum & Death Benefit Allowance (LSDBA): £1,073,100** (standard).
    These cap **tax-free** lump sums in life and on death; amounts **above** are taxed at your **marginal income tax rate**. Transitional protection and certificates can adjust your personal limits. ([GOV.UK][1])

---

# Quick compliance checklist (accumulation-only)

1. **Know your AA today:** default **£60,000** unless **tapered** or **MPAA** applies. ([GOV.UK][1])
2. **Estimate threshold & adjusted income** (per HMRC steps) to see if taper hits you. ([GOV.UK][2])
3. **Check MPAA status** (have you flexibly accessed DC?). If yes, your DC limit is **£10,000** with **no carry-forward** above that for DC. ([GOV.UK][1])
4. **Use carry-forward** (earliest first) from the **previous three** years if needed (and eligible). ([GOV.UK][6])
5. **Coordinate personal & workplace** inputs (all **count together** for AA/taper). ([GOV.UK][2])
6. **Mind AE banding** (if you’re an employer or checking minimums): **£6,240–£50,270**, trigger **£10,000**. ([The Pensions Regulator][4])
7. **Track lifetime lump-sum caps** (LSA **£268,275**, LSDBA **£1,073,100**) for future access planning, even while accumulating. ([GOV.UK][1])
8. **Access age**: plan on **57 from 6 April 2028** unless protected. ([GOV.UK][3])

## Worked scenarios (current rules)

### A) High earner with taper, no MPAA

* Threshold income: **£215,000** → **> £200k** (so taper still possible).
* Adjusted income: **£305,000** → **£45,000** over £260k → taper reduction **£22,500** → AA = **£60,000 − £22,500 = £37,500**. Add any available **carry-forward** to increase headroom. ([GOV.UK][2])

### B) MPAA triggered last year; still accruing in a DB scheme

* DC contributions this year must be **≤ £10,000** (no carry-forward to exceed that DC cap).
* DB accrual still uses **Alternative AA = £50,000** (effectively AA minus MPAA), and you **can use carry-forward** against the **DB** side if available. ([GOV.UK][1])

### C) Using carry-forward to fund a one-off top-up

* Current year DC/DB total: **£120,000**.
* AA = **£60,000** (no taper).
* Unused AA: **2022/23: £20k**, **2023/24: £10k**, **2024/25: £15k** → add **£45k**.
* Total headroom = **£105k** → excess **£15k** would face AA charge unless you can re-profile or reduce employer inputs. (Use earliest carry-forward first.) ([GOV.UK][6])

---

## Definitions you’ll see in scheme paperwork (HMRC bases)

* **Threshold income**/**Adjusted income**: precise calculations HMRC sets out for taper tests (see “Work out your reduced AA”). ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Pension input amount (DB):** (closing DB value − opening DB value) with **16×** factor plus any separate lump-sum element, adjusted by prior September **CPI** for the opening value. ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Relief-at-source vs Net pay**: affects how relief is granted and how **threshold income** is computed. ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Flexible access (triggers):** events (e.g., UFPLS, taxable flexi-access drawdown income) that **trigger the MPAA** from that tax year onward. ([GOV.UK][5])

## Auto-enrolment: exact 2025/26 thresholds at a glance

* **Earnings trigger:** **£10,000**/year.
* **Lower qualifying earnings limit:** **£6,240**/year.
* **Upper qualifying earnings limit:** **£50,270**/year.
  (Confirmed by The Pensions Regulator and DWP’s 2025/26 review outcome.) ([The Pensions Regulator][4])

## What this means for *accumulating only* (not drawdown)

* You can **maximise employer match** first (workplace), then **supplement via personal/SIPP** while staying within **AA/taper/MPAA**.
* If you’re near **taper territory**, consider the **threshold/adjusted** income mechanics (e.g., post-2015 salary sacrifice is added back) when planning. ([GOV.UK][2])
* If you have **older small pots or DB** alongside DC, plan **carry-forward** strategically (remember: **no carry-forward to exceed MPAA for DC**). ([GOV.UK][7])
* Keep a running record of **lump sums** for future reference against **LSA/LSDBA**. ([GOV.UK][1])
