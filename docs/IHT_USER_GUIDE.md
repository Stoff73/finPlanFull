## Understanding IHT Calculations

### How IHT is Calculated

The calculation follows this order:

1. **Gross Estate**: Add up all assets at market value
2. **Deduct Liabilities**: Subtract debts, funeral expenses
3. **Net Estate**: Gross estate minus liabilities
4. **Apply Exemptions**: Spouse exemption, charity gifts
5. **Chargeable Estate**: Net estate after exemptions
6. **Add Gifts**: Include CLTs and failed PETs (within 7 years)
7. **Cumulative Total**: Estate + chargeable gifts
8. **Apply Nil-Rate Bands**: NRB and RNRB
9. **Calculate Tax**: 40% (or 36%) on amount above NRBs

### Example Full Calculation

**Scenario**: John dies leaving an estate of Â£2.5M, including his Â£400K home to his daughter.

```
Step 1: Gross Estate
- Main residence: Â£400,000
- Investments: Â£1,800,000
- Personal effects: Â£300,000
Total: Â£2,500,000

Step 2: Liabilities
- Mortgage: Â£100,000
- Funeral: Â£5,000
Total: Â£105,000

Step 3: Net Estate
Â£2,500,000 - Â£105,000 = Â£2,395,000

Step 4: Exemptions
- Charitable gift: Â£50,000
Chargeable estate: Â£2,345,000

Step 5: Add Gifts (within 7 years)
- Gift to son (5 years ago): Â£150,000
- Less: Annual exemption: Â£3,000
- Less: Taper relief (60%): Â£58,800
Chargeable gift: Â£88,200

Step 6: Cumulative Total
Â£2,345,000 + Â£88,200 = Â£2,433,200

Step 7: Apply Nil-Rate Bands
- Standard NRB: Â£325,000
- RNRB: Â£175,000 (home to direct descendant)
- Total tax-free: Â£500,000

Step 8: RNRB Taper Check
Estate over Â£2M, so RNRB tapers:
Â£2,433,200 - Â£2,000,000 = Â£433,200 over threshold
RNRB reduction: Â£433,200 Ã· 2 = Â£216,600
Reduced RNRB: Â£175,000 - Â£175,000 = Â£0 (fully tapered)

Revised NRB: Â£325,000 only

Step 9: Calculate Tax
Taxable: Â£2,433,200 - Â£325,000 = Â£2,108,200
IHT due: Â£2,108,200 Ã— 40% = Â£843,280
```

### RNRB Tapering Explained

The Residence Nil-Rate Band (RNRB) tapers when the net estate exceeds Â£2 million.

**Taper rate**: Â£1 reduction for every Â£2 over the threshold

**Examples**:

| Estate Value | Amount Over Â£2M | RNRB Reduction | Remaining RNRB |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Â£2,000,000   | Â£0              | Â£0             | Â£175,000       |
| Â£2,100,000   | Â£100,000        | Â£50,000        | Â£125,000       |
| Â£2,200,000   | Â£200,000        | Â£100,000       | Â£75,000        |
| Â£2,350,000+  | Â£350,000+       | Â£175,000       | Â£0             |

**Key points**:
- RNRB fully disappears at Â£2.35M
- Only applies if home passes to direct descendants
- Can be transferred between spouses (TRNRB)

### Taper Relief on Gifts

Taper relief reduces IHT on PETs given 3-7 years before death.

**Important**: Taper relief reduces the TAX, not the gift value.

**Example**:
```
Gift of Â£500,000 made 5 years ago
Less: NRB available: Â£325,000
Taxable: Â£175,000
IHT at 40%: Â£70,000
Taper relief (60%): -Â£42,000
IHT due: Â£28,000
```

**Without taper relief, IHT would be Â£70,000. With 60% taper (5 years), it's reduced to Â£28,000.**

### Charitable Rate Reduction

If you leave 10% or more of your net estate to charity, the IHT rate reduces from 40% to 36%.

**Calculation**:

1. Calculate baseline amount (net estate after NRBs but before charitable gift)
2. Check if charitable gift â‰¥ 10% of baseline
3. If yes, apply 36% rate instead of 40%

**Example**:
```
Net estate: Â£1,000,000
NRB: Â£325,000
Baseline: Â£675,000

Charitable gift: Â£70,000 (10.37% of Â£675,000)
Qualifies for reduced rate âœ“

Chargeable estate: Â£930,000 (Â£1M - Â£70K)
Less NRB: Â£325,000
Taxable: Â£605,000

IHT at 36%: Â£217,800
(vs. Â£242,000 at 40% without charity)

Net benefit:
- Tax saved: Â£24,200
- Charity receives: Â£70,000
- Estate receives: Â£45,800 less, but saves Â£24,200 = Â£21,600 actual cost
```

### Business Property Relief (BR)

BR provides relief on qualifying business assets:

**100% Relief**:
- Shares in unquoted trading companies
- AIM shares (if trading company)
- Sole trader business assets

**50% Relief**:
- Controlling shareholding in quoted company

- Assets used in business

**Requirements**:
- Owned for 2+ years
- Trading business (not investment)
- Not excepted assets (cash, investments)

**Post-April 2026**: BR and APR capped at Â£1M per person

### Agricultural Property Relief (APR)

**100% Relief**:
- Owner occupied for 2+ years
- Let for agricultural use for 7+ years

**50% Relief**:
- Certain lettings

**Qualifying property**:
- Farmland

- Cottages for farm workers
- Farmhouse (if character appropriate)

## Advanced Features

### Multiple Marriage Tracking

If you're claiming unused nil-rate bands from deceased spouse(s), track multiple marriages:

1. Navigate to **Estate Scenarios** or use advanced calculator
2. Add deceased spouse details:
   - Date of death
   - Estate value at death
   - IHT paid
   - Unused NRB percentage
   - Unused RNRB percentage

3. System calculates:
   - Transferred NRB (TNRB)
   - Transferred RNRB (TRNRB)
   - Maximum: 100% additional from all spouses combined

**Example**:
```
First spouse died 2010:
- Used 50% of NRB
- Available TNRB: 50%

Second spouse died 2018:
- Used 30% of NRB
- Available TNRB: 70%

However, combined TNRB capped at 100%
Your total NRB: Â£325K + Â£325K = Â£650K
```

### Downsizing Addition

If you downsize or sell your home after 8 July 2015, you may still get RNRB.

**Rules**:
1. Sold/disposed of main residence after 8 July 2015
2. Estate includes a qualifying residential interest OR
3. Assets of equivalent value passed to direct descendants
4. Total estate must be under RNRB taper threshold (Â£2M)

**Calculation**:
```
Previous home value: Â£500,000
RNRB limit: Â£175,000
Capped at: Â£175,000

Current home value: Â£100,000
Shortfall: Â£75,000

Other assets to descendants: Â£200,000
Downsizing addition: Â£75,000 (limited to shortfall)

Total RNRB: Â£100,000 + Â£75,000 = Â£175,000
```

### Gift with Reservation (GWR)

A gift where you retain a benefit is treated as still being in your estate.

**Examples of GWR**:
- Gift house to children but continue living there rent-free
- Gift shares but retain dividends
- Gift property but keep a key and use it

**Consequences**:
- Asset still in estate for IHT
- May trigger Pre-Owned Assets Tax (POAT) during lifetime

**Avoiding GWR**:
1. Pay market rent if using gifted property
2. Make gift outright with no benefit
3. Structure as trust (but trust charges apply)

**Our system**:
- Flags potential GWR gifts
- Calculates POAT liability
- Suggests compliant alternatives

### Quick Succession Relief (QSR)

If you inherit assets and die within 5 years, QSR reduces IHT on those assets.

**Relief scale**:
| Death Within | Relief |
|--------------|--------|
| 1 year       | 100%   |
| 1-2 years    | 80%    |
| 2-3 years    | 60%    |
| 3-4 years    | 40%    |
| 4-5 years    | 20%    |
| 5+ years     | 0%     |

**Calculation**:
```
Inheritance received: Â£400,000
IHT paid on it: Â£160,000
Death 3.5 years later

QSR: Â£160,000 Ã— 40% = Â£64,000
IHT liability reduced by Â£64,000
```

### Foreign Assets and Domicile

UK domicile determines worldwide IHT exposure.

**UK Domiciled**:
- IHT on worldwide assets
- All reliefs available

**Non-UK Domiciled**:
- IHT on UK assets only
- Excluded property: Non-UK assets

**Deemed Domicile** (from April 2025):
- Based on residence, not domicile
- Resident for 10+ years of last 20 years

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General IHT Questions

**Q: Do I need to worry about IHT?**

A: Check these factors:
- Is your estate over Â£325,000? (or Â£500,000 with RNRB)
- Are you married? Spouse exemption applies
- Have you made gifts over Â£3,000/year?
- Do you have business/agricultural property?

Most estates under Â£500,000 have no IHT, especially if married.

**Q: Can I give away everything and avoid IHT?**

A: Technically yes, but:
- You must survive 7 years after gifting
- Gifts with reservation don't work
- You need income/assets to live on
- POAT may apply if you retain benefit

**Q: How does being married affect IHT?**

A: Major benefits:
- Unlimited spouse exemption (if UK domiciled)
- Can transfer unused NRB to surviving spouse
- Can transfer unused RNRB to surviving spouse

**Q: How does the 7-year rule work?**

A: Gifts become exempt if you survive 7 years:
- 0-3 years: Full IHT if you die

- 7+ years: Fully exempt

But cumulation rules apply for CLTs.

### Gift Questions

**Q: What's the difference between PET and CLT?**

A:
- **PET**: Gift to individual. No immediate IHT. Becomes exempt after 7 years.
- **CLT**: Gift to trust. May have immediate IHT. Counts in cumulation for 7 years.

**Q: Can I use annual exemption on CLT?**

**Q: What happens if I make gifts exceeding annual exemption?**

A:

**Q: Can I give wedding gifts?**

A: Yes, special exemptions:
- To your child: Â£5,000

**Q: What is "normal expenditure out of income"?**

A: Gifts that are:
- Made regularly (pattern established)

### Technical Questions

**Q: How is taper relief calculated?**

A: On the TAX, not the gift:
```
Gift: Â£425,000 (4.5 years before death)
Less NRB: Â£325,000
Taxable: Â£100,000
Tax at 40%: Â£40,000
Taper relief at 40%: Â£16,000
IHT due: Â£24,000
```

**Q: How does RNRB tapering work exactly?**

A: Â£1 reduction per Â£2 over Â£2M:
```
Estate: Â£2,200,000
Excess: Â£200,000
Reduction: Â£200,000 Ã· 2 = Â£100,000
RNRB: Â£175,000 - Â£100,000 = Â£75,000
```

**Q: Can I get RNRB if I don't own a home?**

A: Possibly, through downsizing addition:
- Must have owned qualifying residence after 8 July 2015
- Disposed of it
- Leave assets of equivalent value to descendants

**Q: How does the charitable rate reduction work?**

A:
1. Calculate baseline (estate - NRBs, before charity)
2. Check if charity â‰¥ 10% of baseline
3. If yes, use 36% instead of 40% on remaining estate

Net effect: Costs about 1.5% to give 10% to charity.

**Q: What's cumulation in relation to gifts?**

A:
- CLTs cumulate for 7 years
- Later gifts use up earlier NRB
- Example:
  - Year 1: CLT Â£100,000 (uses Â£100K of NRB)
  - Year 3: CLT Â£250,000 (uses remaining Â£225K of NRB, Â£25K taxable)

**Q: Can I transfer RNRB if my spouse didn't own a home?**

A: From 6 April 2017, yes:
- RNRB introduced 6 April 2017
- If first death before this, can still transfer unused portion
- Based on proportion, not actual value
