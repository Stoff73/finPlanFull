### Video 2.1: Understanding Inheritance Tax (6 minutes) - ⚠️ DEPRECATED

**Target Audience**: Users new to UK IHT
**Prerequisites**: None (standalone)
**Learning Outcomes**: Understand IHT basics, thresholds, rates

#### Script

**[INTRO - 0:00-0:20]**

```
Visual: Title slide with UK map and IHT graphics

Voiceover: "Before we dive into calculating Inheritance Tax,
let's understand what it is, how it works, and who it affects.
This video will give you the foundation you need to use our
IHT calculator effectively."

On-screen text: "Understanding UK Inheritance Tax"
```

**[WHAT IS IHT - 0:20-1:15]**

```
Visual: Animated diagram showing wealth transfer

Voiceover: "Inheritance Tax, or IHT, is a tax on the estate
of someone who has died. Your estate includes all your assets
- property, investments, savings, possessions - minus any
debts and liabilities."

Visual: Show calculation:
Assets (£800,000) - Liabilities (£200,000) = Estate (£600,000)

Voiceover: "The tax is paid before the estate is distributed
to beneficiaries. It's one of the UK's most misunderstood
taxes, but with proper planning, you can minimize or even
eliminate it."

Visual: Statistics graphic
- Only 4% of UK estates pay IHT
- But average bill is £200,000+

Voiceover: "Only about 4% of estates pay IHT, but for those
that do, the average bill is over £200,000. That's why
planning ahead is so important."
```

**[NIL-RATE BAND - 1:15-2:30]**

```
Visual: Animated threshold graphic

Voiceover: "The first £325,000 of your estate is tax-free.
This is called the Nil-Rate Band, or NRB."

Visual: Show estate example:
Estate: £400,000
NRB: £325,000 (tax-free)
Taxable: £75,000

Voiceover: "Any value above £325,000 is potentially taxable.
For example, if your estate is worth £400,000, only £75,000
would be taxable."

Visual: Married couple graphic

Voiceover: "Here's where it gets interesting for married
couples and civil partners. When the first spouse dies, any
unused NRB can be transferred to the surviving spouse."

Visual: Show TNRB example:
Spouse 1 dies: Uses £0 of £325,000 NRB
Spouse 2 gets: £325,000 (own) + £325,000 (transferred) = £650,000

Voiceover: "This means a surviving spouse could have a
Nil-Rate Band of up to £650,000 - double the standard amount.
This is called the Transferable Nil-Rate Band, or TNRB."
```

**[RESIDENCE NIL-RATE BAND - 2:30-3:45]**

```
Visual: House graphic with family tree

Voiceover: "There's an additional allowance for your main
residence. It's called the Residence Nil-Rate Band, or RNRB."

Visual: Show RNRB details:
- Additional £175,000 allowance
- Only for main residence
- Must pass to direct descendants
- Available from 2017

Voiceover: "You get an extra £175,000 tax-free if you leave
your main home to your children or grandchildren - direct
descendants only."

Visual: Show combined thresholds:
NRB: £325,000
RNRB: £175,000
Total: £500,000 per person

Voiceover: "Combined with the standard NRB, that's £500,000
per person, or up to £1 million for a married couple."

Visual: Show taper warning graphic

Voiceover: "But there's a catch. If your estate is worth more
than £2 million, the RNRB reduces by £1 for every £2 over
that threshold."

Visual: Show taper example:
Estate: £2.2 million (£200k over)
RNRB reduced by: £100,000
RNRB available: £75,000 (instead of £175,000)

Voiceover: "For example, an estate worth £2.2 million loses
£100,000 of the RNRB, reducing it to just £75,000."
```

**[TAX RATES - 3:45-4:30]**

```
Visual: Tax rate graphic

Voiceover: "The standard IHT rate is 40% on everything above
your tax-free threshold."

Visual: Show calculation:
Estate: £825,000
Threshold: £500,000
Taxable: £325,000
Tax (40%): £130,000

Voiceover: "So an estate worth £825,000 with a £500,000
threshold would pay £130,000 in tax - 40% of the £325,000
taxable amount."

Visual: Charity graphic

Voiceover: "There's a reduced rate of 36% if you leave at
least 10% of your net estate to charity."

Visual: Show charity example:
Estate: £825,000
10% to charity: £82,500
Reduced rate: 36% instead of 40%
Tax saved: ~£13,000

Voiceover: "This can save thousands while supporting causes
you care about."
```

**[GIFTS & 7-YEAR RULE - 4:30-5:30]**

```
Visual: Timeline graphic showing 7 years

Voiceover: "Gifts you make during your lifetime can also
affect IHT. If you die within 7 years of making a gift, it
may be taxable."

Visual: Show gift timeline:
Year 0: Gift made (£100,000)
Years 0-3: Full IHT if die
Years 3-7: Tapered relief
After 7 years: Completely exempt

Voiceover: "But here's the good news - there's taper relief.
If you survive 3 years, the tax reduces gradually. After 7
years, the gift is completely exempt."

Visual: Show taper relief schedule:
- 3-4 years: 20% relief
- 4-5 years: 40% relief
- 5-6 years: 60% relief
- 6-7 years: 80% relief
- 7+ years: 100% relief (no tax)

Voiceover: "This is called the 7-year rule, and it's crucial
for IHT planning."
```

**[EXEMPTIONS - 5:30-6:00]**

```
Visual: List of exemptions

Voiceover: "Finally, there are several exemptions that can
reduce your IHT:"

Visual: Show exemptions list:
- Annual exemption: £3,000/year
- Small gifts: £250 per person
- Wedding gifts: £5,000 (child), £2,500 (grandchild)
- Spouse/civil partner: Unlimited
- Charities: Unlimited

Voiceover: "
• You can give away £3,000 each year tax-free
• Small gifts of £250 to as many people as you like
• Wedding gifts up to £5,000 for children
• Unlimited transfers to your spouse or civil partner
• Unlimited donations to charities"

NRB, you can transfer the unused portion. Use the slider to
