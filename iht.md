You’re right — let’s crank this up. Below is a comprehensive, up-to-date, source-backed compendium of UK Inheritance Tax (IHT) rules, rates, allowances, reliefs, who pays, when it’s due, how to claim, and the edge-cases people miss.

---

# 1) Core thresholds, rates & who pays

**Standard rate:** 40% on the value of the chargeable estate above available allowances. **Reduced rate:** 36% if you leave at least 10% of the “baseline amount” to charity (see §7).

**Nil-rate band (NRB):** £325,000 per person (transferable to a spouse/civil partner — see §3). The government has confirmed the NRB freeze will run **to April 2030**. ([House of Commons Library][1])

**Residence nil-rate band (RNRB):** up to **£175,000** per person where a qualifying residence passes to direct descendants; it **tapers £1 for every £2** that the estate exceeds **£2 million**; it does **not** cover lifetime gifts (only the death estate). Transferable between spouses/civil partners; downsizing rules apply (see §4).

**Who is within scope (domicile/residence):** From **6 April 2025** the IHT connecting factor changed: **domicile was replaced by a residence-based system** with “long-term UK resident” rules; HMRC’s IHT Manual now points here for scope. (Before 6 Apr 2025, “domicile/deemed domicile (15/20 rule)” applied.) Check HMRC’s updated pages for the current tests.

---

# 2) What’s in the estate & valuation basics

**What’s counted:** All UK assets; for people within scope under the current rules, worldwide assets (see §1). Valuation is **open-market value at date of death**. HMRC expects professional evidence for significant assets (property, businesses, art). The Valuation Office Agency (VOA) handles landed property queries.

**Relief for post-death price drops:**

* **Quoted shares** sold at a loss **within 12 months** of death — claim “loss on sale of shares” relief. ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Land/buildings** sold at a loss **within 4 years** of death — claim “loss on sale of land” relief. ([GOV.UK][3])

---

# 3) Spouse/civil partner rules

* **Unlimited spouse/civil partner exemption** between two people who both meet the UK-scope conditions (under pre-April-2025 rules: both UK-domiciled or the donee elected to be UK-domiciled).
* **Non-UK-domiciled spouse limit (historic):** where the transferor was UK-domiciled but the spouse wasn’t, the lifetime/death exemption was **capped at the NRB** unless the non-dom spouse elected to be treated as UK-domiciled for IHT. HMRC still signposts this background and the election mechanism. (Post-6 Apr 2025 the manual cross-refers to the new residence rules.)

**Transferable NRB (TNRB):** On the second death you can **boost** the survivor’s NRB by the **percentage** of unused NRB from the first death — claimed with **IHT402** alongside IHT400.

---

# 4) Residence Nil-Rate Band (RNRB) — the extra home allowance

**Amount & scope:** Up to **£175,000** per person against a **qualifying residential interest** that is **closely inherited** by **direct descendants** (includes children, step-children, adopted and foster children). It **does not** shelter lifetime gifts.

**Tapering:** RNRB reduces by **£1 for every £2** that the **net estate** exceeds **£2,000,000**.

**Transfer & downsizing:**

* **Transfer unused RNRB** from a pre-deceased spouse/civil partner using **IHT436** and claim via **IHT435**.
* **Downsizing addition** applies if the deceased sold or downsized **on/after 8 July 2015** and left equivalent value to descendants.

**Trusts that can still qualify:** IPDI (immediate post-death interest) for a direct descendant, bereaved minors/18-25, and disabled person’s trusts can preserve RNRB; typical discretionary trusts do not. (See HMRC RNRB manual.)

---

# 5) Lifetime gifting framework

**Gift types:**

* **Exempt gifts** (see §6): spouse/civil partner, charity, political parties, small gifts, annual exemption, normal expenditure out of income, wedding gifts, certain maintenance.
* **Potentially exempt transfers (PETs):** gifts to individuals become fully exempt if the donor survives **7 years**. If death occurs earlier, the gift **uses NRB** first; **taper relief** may reduce tax on the **gift’s tax** (not its value) after 3 years. ([GOV.UK][4])
* **Chargeable lifetime transfers (CLTs):** mainly transfers into most trusts; **20% lifetime IHT** on the **excess above available NRB** (25% if the donor bears the tax gross). Cumulate CLTs over 7 years when computing entry charges and later periodic/exit charges. (HMRC IHTM explains the cumulation mechanics.)

**Taper relief table (on the tax due on a failed PET/CLT amount above NRB):**
0–3 yrs: **0%** reduction; 3–4: **20%**; 4–5: **40%**; 5–6: **60%**; 6–7: **80%**. ([GOV.UK][4])

---

# 6) Everyday gift exemptions & how they really work

* **Annual exemption:** **£3,000** per tax year; unused can be **carried forward one year** only.
* **Small gifts:** unlimited gifts of up to **£250 per person per tax year** (cannot combine with the annual exemption for the same person that year).
* **Wedding/civil partnership gifts:** up to **£5,000** (parent), **£2,500** (grandparent/great-grandparent), **£1,000** (anyone else). Can be combined with the £3,000 annual exemption.
* **Normal expenditure out of income (no monetary cap):** gifts are immediately outside the estate **if** all three tests are met: (1) part of **normal** expenditure; (2) made **out of income**; (3) leave the donor with **enough income** to maintain their usual standard of living. HMRC expects records; IHT403 has a schedule to evidence this on death. (Note: for **excepted estates** tests, there’s a specific cap interaction – gifts relying on this exemption over **£3,000 per year** must be considered in the excepted-estate assessment.)

---

# 7) Charity & the **36% reduced rate**

Leave **≥10% of the baseline amount** to charity to cut the estate rate from **40% to 36%**. The calculation works by “components” of the estate (general component, survivorship, settled property components). HMRC’s guidance explains how to compute the **baseline amount** and how to make the **election** to apply 36%.

---

# 8) Property/business/agriculture reliefs (the big ones)

## 8.1 Business Relief (BR / BPR)

**Purpose:** reduces the value of **relevant business property** for IHT by **100%** or **50%** subject to conditions.
**100%**: an unincorporated business or interest in one; **unquoted shares** (including AIM).
**50%**: controlling holdings of **quoted** shares; certain land/buildings/machinery used in a qualifying business you control or are a partner in.
**Ownership period:** generally **2 years**.
**Exclusions:** investment businesses (mainly dealing in securities, stocks and shares, land or buildings, or holding investments), assets not used for the business (**excepted assets**) etc.

> **Reform note (policy change):** In **Autumn Budget 2024** the government announced that **Agricultural Property Relief and Business Relief will be capped at £1 million per person from April 2026** (with targeted anti-forestalling and planned consultation). Keep this in view if succession planning involves large BR/APR claims. ([GOV.UK][5])

## 8.2 Agricultural Property Relief (APR)

Relief for the **agricultural value** of qualifying farmland, farmhouses and buildings; rate can be **100% or 50%** depending on ownership/occupation, with **minimum occupation/ownership periods** and “character-appropriate” tests for farmhouses. (And see the **£1m cap from April 2026** above.) ([GOV.UK][5])

---

# 9) Trusts & IHT (entry, 10-year, exit charges)

**Relevant property regime (most discretionary trusts etc.):**

* **Entry (CLT)**: see §5.
* **10-year (periodic) charge:** up to **6%** of the **relevant property** at each 10-year anniversary (complex effective-rate calculation).
* **Exit charges**: up to **6%** (pro-rated since last 10-year charge).

**Interest-in-possession trusts (e.g., IPDI post-death):** generally the trust fund is treated as part of the life tenant’s death estate (so no 10-year/exit charges while the interest subsists). (See HMRC settled-property/IIP guidance in the IHTM.) ([GOV.UK][6])

**Reporting for trusts/lifetime events:** HMRC replaced the IHT100 suite in 2024 with **event-specific forms** (still commonly referred to as IHT100 and schedules, e.g., **IHT100d** for 10-year charges).

---

# 10) Gifts with strings attached — anti-avoidance

* **Gifts with reservation of benefit (GWR):** if you give something away **but keep using/benefiting from it**, it’s treated as still in your estate. (Classic: gift of house but you keep living there rent-free.) ([GOV.UK][7])
* **Pre-Owned Assets Tax (POAT):** an **income tax** charge that can apply where arrangements sidestep GWR (e.g., funding a trust then occupying the asset). There’s an election route to bring the asset back into IHT instead in some cases. ([Croneri Library][8])

---

# 11) Special classes & exclusions

* **Charities, registered sports clubs**: exempt. **Political parties**: exempt if they meet representation conditions. (Covered in HMRC general guidance.)
* **Excluded property (non-UK assets in certain cases):** historically, non-UK assets of people outside UK scope and assets in **excluded-property trusts**; check current **residence-based** scope rules post-6 Apr 2025.
* **Quick Succession Relief (QSR):** reduces tax where the same value suffers IHT **twice within 5 years** (100% within 1 year, then 80/60/40/20%). Claimed on the second estate.

---

# 12) Pensions & IHT (important reform)

Historically most **defined contribution pension pots** outside drawdown/crystallisation were usually outside IHT. Following **Autumn Budget 2024**, the government has legislated/confirmed policy so that **most unused pension funds will be within the IHT estate from April 2027**, with detail set out in HM Treasury consultation and response. Review pension beneficiary designations and estate liquidity in light of this. ([GOV.UK][9])

---

# 13) How the calculation is applied (ordering rules)

1. Value the **death estate** at market value (less allowable debts, funeral expenses).
2. Add back **chargeable lifetime transfers** in the **7 years** before death for rate-setting (and earlier CLTs in the **14-year interaction** can matter where CLTs precede PETs — see HMRC on cumulation).
3. Apply **reliefs** (BR/APR) to qualifying assets.
4. Deduct **RNRB** (if conditions met; **note:** RNRB **does not** set against lifetime gifts).
5. Deduct **NRB/TNRB**.
6. Compute tax at **40%** or **36%** (if the **10% charity** test is met).

---

# 14) Reporting & forms (death estates)

* **Excepted estates (England & Wales, from 1 Jan 2022 rules):** many estates below thresholds or meeting specific conditions no longer file IHT forms with HMRC; the probate application carries the necessary data. Check criteria carefully.
* **Full account:** **IHT400** plus schedules (e.g., **IHT402** for transferable NRB, **IHT435/IHT436** for RNRB/transfer, **IHT403** for lifetime gifts, **IHT412/413** for business/partnerships, **IHT414** APR, **IHT411** listed shares, etc.). HMRC’s calculator pages show how items feed into the IHT400 calc.

---

# 15) Deadlines, paying, instalments & interest

* **Due date:** **End of the 6th month after the month of death** (e.g., death in January → due by **31 July**). Interest accrues after the due date.
* **Instalments (10 years):** available for certain **illiquid/qualifying assets** (e.g., land/houses kept, controlling holdings, certain unlisted shares, a business). First instalment due by the normal due date; interest usually applies to later instalments; outstanding tax becomes due on **sale**. (Election is made in **IHT400**.)
* **Statutory basis:** **IHTA 1984 s.227** et seq. set the instalment rules.
* **Current HMRC late-payment interest rate:** **8.00% from 27 Aug 2025** (HMRC master rates page). Always check the live rate.

---

# 16) Residence nil-rate band: practical pitfalls & claims

* **Only one residence can be used**; executors can choose which if several existed. Must have been a **residence of the deceased** at some time (BTLs never occupied won’t qualify).
* **Direct descendants** definition is **specific**; check HMRC list (step-children included).
* **Claims:** use **IHT435** (RNRB) and, if relevant, **IHT436** (transfer).

---

# 17) Valuation deep-dive (property, shares, chattels)

* **Property:** obtain an evidence-based market valuation at death; the VOA may review. Post-death sales at lower prices may justify **loss on sale of land** relief (within 4 years). ([GOV.UK][3])
* **Quoted investments:** value at the **quarter-up** rule around death date; if sold at a loss within **12 months**, consider the **shares loss relief**. ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Chattels/household goods:** list on **IHT407** (schedule to IHT400); HMRC expects realistic market figures (auctions, dealer quotes). (See IHT400 schedules index.)

---

# 18) Business & farming specifics (selected points people miss)

* **2-year ownership**: required for BR in most cases; replacement property/successive ownership rules can preserve relief in mergers/restructures. **Excepted assets** within a business don’t attract BR.
* **APR scope:** usually only the **agricultural value** (not development value); farmhouses must be “**character appropriate**” and part of the working unit; occupation/ownership period tests apply. (Also see the **£1m APR cap from April 2026**). ([GOV.UK][5])

---

# 19) Quick Succession Relief (numbers at a glance)

If an estate includes assets received on a chargeable transfer **within 5 years**, reduce tax on the second estate by a percentage of the earlier tax:
≤1 year: **100%**; 1–2: **80%**; 2–3: **60%**; 3–4: **40%**; 4–5: **20%**. (Claim on IHT400 computation.)

---

# 20) Administration: excepted estates & where forms are not needed

**Excepted estate** criteria (England & Wales, effective from **1 Jan 2022**): where the value, reliefs, and lifetime gift patterns meet the regulations, **no IHT forms to HMRC** are needed — probate application includes declarations instead. Read HMRC’s current **excepted estates** guide carefully (different rules for Scotland/NI processes and for deaths before 2022).

---

# 21) Common traps & misconceptions (with corrections)

* **“Taper relief reduces the gift value.”**
  False — it reduces **the tax** on gifts above NRB when death occurs **3–7 years** after the gift. ([GOV.UK][4])
* **“RNRB covers gifts within 7 years.”**
  No — RNRB only applies to the **death estate**, not to lifetime transfers.
* **“Normal-expenditure gifts don’t need records.”**
  HMRC expects multi-year **income/expenditure evidence** (IHT403 schedule) to accept the exemption.
* **“All spouse transfers are unlimited.”**
  Not always under historic domicile rules — the **non-dom spouse cap** applied unless an election was made (see §3).

---

# 22) Paying the bill — routes & options

* **Direct Payment Scheme (DPS):** banks/building societies can pay IHT **direct to HMRC** from the deceased’s accounts. (See HMRC paying IHT guide.)
* **Instalments (10 years):** for qualifying assets (land, controlling holdings, certain unlisted shares, businesses), with **interest** on later instalments; if you **sell the asset**, the remaining tax becomes **immediately due**.
* **Interest:** check HMRC’s **live rate** (currently **8.00%** late-payment rate **from 27 Aug 2025**).

---

# 23) What changed recently (planning watch-outs)

* **NRB & RNRB frozen to April 2030** (Autumn 2024 Budget). ([House of Commons Library][1])
* **Pensions & IHT:** most **unused pension funds to be within IHT** from **April 2027** — revisit beneficiary, trust and liquidity planning. ([GOV.UK][9])
* **APR/BR cap:** **£1 million per person** cap **from April 2026** (policy confirmed; consultation published). ([GOV.UK][5])
* **Scope basis:** from **6 April 2025**, IHT connects via **residence (long-term resident)** rather than domicile — check HMRC for the tests and transitional rules.
* **IHT100 forms:** redesigned in 2024 into event-specific reporting.

---

## Useful official claim forms (direct links)

* **IHT402** (transferable NRB) — use with IHT400.
* **IHT435** (RNRB claim) & **IHT436** (transfer unused RNRB).
* **IHT403** (lifetime gifts, includes the **normal-expenditure** schedule).
* **IHT100d** (10-year principal charge for relevant-property trusts).
