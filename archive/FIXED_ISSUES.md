## Issue: Infinite Redirect Loop After Login
**Status: ✅ FIXED**

### Problem Description
After logging in, the application was stuck in an infinite redirect loop causing:
- Browser error: "Attempt to use history.replaceState() more than 100 times per 10 seconds"
- Application became unresponsive
- Console flooded with error messages

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Dashboard.tsx** was calling `navigate('/login')` when no token found, creating a race condition
2. **App.tsx** had React Hooks rule violation - `useMemo` was called after conditional return
3. **Login.tsx** was using `window.location.href` causing full page reload conflicts

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Dashboard.tsx (Line 141-161)
- Removed navigation logic from Dashboard component
- Let App.tsx handle all routing decisions centrally
```javascript
// Commented out problematic navigation
// if (!token) {
//   navigate('/login');
//   return;
// }
```

#### 2. App.tsx (Line 29-110)
- Moved `useMemo` hook before conditional return to fix React hooks violation
- Added proper dependency array with ESLint disable comment
- Removed unused Routes and Route imports
```javascript
// Router creation moved before loading check
const router = React.useMemo(() => ..., [isAuthenticated]);

if (loading) {
  return <LoadingScreen />
}
```

#### 3. Login.tsx (Line 123, 138)
- Changed from `window.location.href = '/dashboard'` to `window.location.reload()`
- This allows App.tsx to handle routing after auth state update
```javascript
// After successful login
window.location.reload(); // Let App.tsx handle navigation
```

### Testing Verification
✅ Backend API: Working correctly
✅ Authentication: Token generation and validation functional
✅ Frontend Compilation: No TypeScript errors
✅ React Hooks: No violations
✅ Browser Console: No runtime errors
✅ Login Flow: Smooth transition without loops

### Current Status
- Application compiles with only minor ESLint warnings (unused variables)
- Login/logout flow works correctly
- No infinite redirect loops
- Dashboard loads successfully after authentication

### Test Credentials
- Username: `testuser`
- Password: `testpass123`

### How to Verify
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Login with test credentials
3. Check browser console (F12) - should have no errors
4. Dashboard should load without redirect issues
5. Logout and login again to verify flow consistency
