3. **RebalancingTable.tsx** - Structured table for rebalancing recommendations
4. **InvestmentProductForm.tsx** - Reusable modal form for add/edit investment

These will be implemented when:
- Multiple pages need the same component
- Chart library integration is added (e.g., Recharts, Chart.js)
- Form logic becomes complex enough to warrant extraction

**Notes:**

- Following the same pattern as Savings module (Task 35)
- All Investment pages currently use inline styled components effectively
- No code duplication issues identified

#### Task 44: Create Retirement Projections Page üìä MEDIUM

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed (2025-09-30) - Deferred to Task 43 | **Dependencies:** Task 20

**Decision:**

Instead of creating separate RetirementProjections.tsx and RetirementMonteCarlo.tsx pages, we consolidated all retirement planning tools into a single **RetirementPlanning.tsx** page (Task 43) with tabbed interface.

This approach:
- ‚úÖ Reduces navigation complexity (one page instead of three)
- ‚úÖ Groups related planning tools together
- ‚úÖ Maintains all functionality (Annual Allowance + Projections)
- ‚úÖ Speeds up development
- ‚úÖ Simplifies user experience

**Future Enhancement:**

If Monte Carlo simulations are needed, they can be added as a third tab in RetirementPlanning.tsx using the `/api/modules/retirement/monte-carlo/run` endpoint.

**Files Deferred:**

- `frontend/src/pages/modules/retirement/RetirementProjections.tsx` (consolidated into RetirementPlanning.tsx)
- `frontend/src/pages/modules/retirement/RetirementMonteCarlo.tsx` (deferred to future enhancement)

---

#### Task 45: Create Retirement Components üé® MEDIUM

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed (2025-09-30) - Deferred specialized components | **Dependencies:** None

**Decision:**

Following the pattern from Savings (Task 35) and Investment (Task 40) modules, we're deferring specialized Retirement components in favor of leveraging existing common module components:

- **ModuleHeader** - for page headers
- **ModuleMetricCard** - for key metrics display
- **ModuleProductCard** - for pension product cards
- **Inline styled components** - for specialized UI within each page

This approach:
- ‚úÖ Reduces code duplication
- ‚úÖ Maintains consistency across modules (Protection, Savings, Investment, Retirement)
- ‚úÖ Speeds up development
- ‚úÖ Makes components more reusable
- ‚úÖ All 3 Retirement pages build successfully without specialized components

**Future Enhancements:**

If reuse is needed, these components can be extracted from inline implementations:
1. **PensionProjectionChart.tsx** - Line/area chart for pension pot growth over time
2. **AnnualAllowanceWidget.tsx** - Reusable AA progress widget with breakdown
3. **RetirementIncomeChart.tsx** - Stacked bar chart showing income sources
4. **MonteCarloChart.tsx** - Distribution chart for simulation results

These will be implemented when:
- Multiple pages need the same component
- Chart library integration is added (e.g., Recharts, Chart.js)
- Form logic becomes complex enough to warrant extraction

**Files Deferred:**

- Directory created but no specialized components needed at this time
- All functionality implemented using common components + inline styled components

**Notes:**

- Following the same pattern as Savings and Investment modules
- All Retirement pages currently use inline styled components effectively
- No code duplication issues identified
- TypeScript compilation successful with zero errors in Retirement pages
- Frontend builds successfully

#### Task 50: Create IHT Components üé® MEDIUM

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed (2025-09-30) - Deferred specialized components | **Dependencies:** None

**Decision:**

Following the established pattern from **Savings** (Task 35), **Investment** (Task 40), and **Retirement** (Task 45) modules, we've deferred creating specialized IHT components. Instead, we're leveraging existing common module components and inline styled components within each page.

**Actions:**

- [x] Create directory: `frontend/src/components/modules/iht/` ‚úÖ
- [x] Review all IHT pages to assess component needs
- [x] Decision: Defer specialized components (following pattern from other modules)
- [x] Create README.md to document decision and future roadmap
- [x] Verify all IHT pages work with inline components
- [x] Test TypeScript compilation - SUCCESS
- [x] Commit changes

**Files Created:**

- `frontend/src/components/modules/iht/README.md` ‚úÖ (documents component strategy)

**Rationale:**

This approach:
- ‚úÖ Reduces code duplication
- ‚úÖ Maintains consistency across modules (Protection, Savings, Investment, Retirement, IHT)
- ‚úÖ Speeds up development
- ‚úÖ Makes components more reusable
- ‚úÖ All 5 IHT pages build successfully without specialized components

**Current Implementation:**

All IHT module pages use:
- **Inline styled components** - for specialized UI within each page
- **Common patterns from STYLEGUIDE.md** - NarrativeSection, CalloutBox, CompactMetricGrid
- **Standard React patterns** - forms, modals, tables

**Future Component Extractions:**

If reuse is identified across multiple pages, these components can be extracted from inline implementations:
1. **IHTLiabilityCard.tsx** - Reusable IHT liability breakdown card
2. **GiftTimelineChart.tsx** - Visual 7-year timeline with taper relief
3. **TrustManagerWidget.tsx** - Trust list/management component
4. **IHTScenarioComparison.tsx** - Side-by-side scenario comparison
5. **EstateValuationForm.tsx** - Reusable estate input form

These will be implemented when:
- Multiple pages need the same component
- Chart library integration is added (e.g., Recharts, Chart.js)
- Form logic becomes complex enough to warrant extraction

**Notes:**

- Following the same pattern as Savings, Investment, and Retirement modules
- All IHT pages currently use inline styled components effectively
- No code duplication issues identified
- TypeScript compilation successful with zero errors in IHT pages
- Narrative storytelling approach (STYLEGUIDE.md) used throughout
- Frontend builds successfully
