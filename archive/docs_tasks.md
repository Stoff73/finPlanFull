**Last Updated**: 2025-09-30 22:50 UTC
**Next Review**: After each phase completion
**Status**: 🟢 Phase 6 Complete + Learning Centre Enabled - Ready for Phase 7 (Documentation)

**Known Issues**:
- ✅ ~~Phase 2 components theme structure~~ - **RESOLVED in Phase 5**
  - Fixed all theme accessors to use correct structure
  - TypeScript compilation now successful
  - All components use `theme.colors.primary` format

**Recent Resolution (2025-09-30 22:50 UTC)**:
- ✅ **Learning Centre 404 Issue - RESOLVED**
  - **Issue**: Learning Centre route returning 404 despite backend implementation complete
  - **Root Cause #1**: LearningCentre.tsx file was disabled (renamed to `.disabled`) due to previous compilation errors
  - **Root Cause #2**: App.tsx route was commented out to prevent compilation failures
  - **Root Cause #3**: Duplicate naming conflict - styled component `DocCategory` conflicted with imported TypeScript interface `DocCategory` from docs service
  - **Resolution Steps**:
    1. Renamed `LearningCentre.tsx.disabled` → `LearningCentre.tsx`
    2. Uncommented Learning Centre import and route in `App.tsx`
    3. Renamed styled component `DocCategory` → `CategoryBadge` to resolve naming conflict
    4. Updated all usages of the styled component throughout the file
  - **Status**: ✅ TypeScript compilation successful, page accessible at `/learning-centre`
  - **Note**: Theme structure was already correct from agent's previous fixes to `.disabled` file
