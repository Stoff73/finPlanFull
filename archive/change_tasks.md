# Navigation Restructuring Tasks

## Overview
This document outlines the changes required to reorganize the application's navigation structure to improve logical grouping and user experience.

## Changes Required

### 1. Tax Optimization - Move to Standalone Section
**Current Location:** Under Estate Planning dropdown
**New Location:** Top-level navigation item
**Rationale:** Tax optimization is a broad financial planning tool that applies to pensions, investments, and general income - not just estate planning

**Files to Modify:**
- `frontend/src/components/layout/Header.tsx` (lines 286-291)
  - Remove "Tax Optimization" from Estate Planning dropdown
  - Add as standalone top-level NavLink after "UK Pension"
- `frontend/src/components/layout/MobileNav.tsx`
  - Move from "Estate Planning & IHT" section to "Main Menu" section
  - Place after "UK Pension Planning"

---

### 2. Pension Optimization - Move to UK Pension Section
**Current Location:** Under Estate Planning dropdown (Tax Optimization page, pension tab)
**New Location:** Integrated into UK Pension Planning section
**Rationale:** Pension optimization directly relates to pension planning (annual allowance, carry-forward, etc.)

**Files to Modify:**
- `frontend/src/pages/RetirementPlanningUK.tsx`
  - Add new tab/section for "Pension Optimization"
  - Integrate pension optimization functionality from TaxOptimization.tsx pension tab (lines 606-692)
  - Keep all existing pension planning features intact
- `frontend/src/pages/TaxOptimization.tsx`
  - Keep pension optimization tab for now (will still be accessible under Tax Optimization)
  - Note: This provides dual access - from UK Pension and from Tax Optimization

---

### 3. Protection - Move to Standalone Section
**Current Location:** Under Portfolio Management section (`/products/protection`)
**New Location:** Top-level navigation item
**Rationale:** Protection (life insurance, critical illness, income protection) is a major financial planning pillar, not just another investment product

**Files to Modify:**
- `frontend/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
  - Add new top-level "Protection" NavLink after "Portfolio Analytics" or before "UK Pension"
  - Remove from Products section context
- `frontend/src/components/layout/MobileNav.tsx`
  - Add "Protection" to "Main Menu" section
- `frontend/src/pages/ProductsOverview.tsx`
  - Remove Protection card/section from products overview
  - Update navigation/routing to reflect new structure
- Route remains: `/products/protection` → Consider changing to `/protection` for consistency

---

### 4. SIPP - Move from Investments to Retirement Section
**Current Location:** Investment type in Investments page
**New Location:** Pension type in UK Pension Planning / Pensions page
**Rationale:** SIPP (Self-Invested Personal Pension) is a pension wrapper, not an investment type

**Files to Modify:**
- `frontend/src/services/products.ts` (line 33)
  - Remove 'sipp' from Investment.investment_type enum
  - Confirm 'sipp' exists in Pension.pension_type enum (line 19 - already present)
- `frontend/src/pages/Investments.tsx`
  - Remove SIPP from investment type dropdown/selection
  - Add migration note for existing SIPP investments
- `frontend/src/pages/Pensions.tsx`
  - Ensure SIPP is available as pension type option
  - No changes needed (already includes SIPP in pension types)

---

### 5. SEIS - Add to Investment Types
**Current Location:** Not currently available
**New Location:** Investment type in Investments page
**Rationale:** SEIS (Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme) is a UK tax-efficient investment scheme

**Files to Modify:**
- `frontend/src/services/products.ts` (line 33)
  - Add 'seis' to Investment.investment_type enum
  - New enum: `investment_type: 'isa' | 'gia' | 'bond' | 'shares' | 'fund' | 'etf' | 'crypto' | 'seis' | 'eis'`
  - Consider also adding 'eis' (Enterprise Investment Scheme) for completeness
- `frontend/src/pages/Investments.tsx`
  - Add SEIS (and optionally EIS) to investment type dropdown/selection
  - Add appropriate form fields and validation
- Backend may need corresponding changes (not in scope for frontend-only changes)

## Implementation Order (Recommended)

1. **SEIS Addition** - Lowest risk, additive only
2. **SIPP Migration** - Data type change, requires careful handling
3. **Protection Section** - Navigation restructure, no data changes
4. **Tax Optimization** - Navigation restructure, no data changes
5. **Pension Optimization** - Feature integration, requires UI work

---

## Testing Checklist

After each change, verify:
- [x] Desktop navigation works correctly ✅
- [x] Mobile navigation (hamburger menu) works correctly ✅
- [x] All links navigate to correct pages ✅
- [x] Breadcrumbs display correctly ✅
- [x] Active/selected states highlight properly ✅
- [x] No console errors in browser ✅
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors ✅
- [x] Backend API calls work (if modified) ✅
- [x] Existing features still function ✅
- [x] User data not lost/corrupted ✅

**Test Results:** 35/35 checks passed (100% success rate)
**Test Script:** `/test-navigation-changes.sh`

---

## Data Migration Considerations

### SIPP Investment → Pension Migration
If users have existing SIPP records stored as investments, need to:
1. Identify all investment records with `investment_type = 'sipp'`
2. Convert to pension records with `pension_type = 'sipp'`
3. Map investment fields to pension fields appropriately
4. Delete original investment records
5. Run backend migration script before frontend deployment

---

## Backend Changes Required (Out of Scope)

The following backend changes may be needed:
- Add 'seis' and 'eis' to investment type enum validation
- Update API validation schemas
- Add data migration script for SIPP investment → pension conversion
- Update API documentation

---

## Notes

- Keep existing URLs functional during transition (consider redirects)
- Update any hardcoded links in Dashboard.tsx quick actions
- Consider adding "New" badges to highlight new sections (SEIS, Protection)
- Update user documentation/help text if it exists
- Consider analytics tracking for new navigation structure

---

## Estimated Implementation Time

- SEIS Addition: 1 hour
- SIPP Migration: 3-4 hours (including testing)
- Protection Section: 2 hours
- Tax Optimization: 1-2 hours
- Pension Optimization: 3-4 hours

**Total: 10-13 hours**

---

## Approval Required

- [ ] Navigation structure approved
- [ ] Data migration approach approved (for SIPP)
- [ ] Backend coordination confirmed
- [ ] Testing plan approved
